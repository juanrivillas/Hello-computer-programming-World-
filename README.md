# Hello-computer-programming-World-
I'm a PhD student in Clinical Medicine Research at Imperial's School of Public Health within Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology supervised by Professors Paolo Vineis (ICL, Exposome) and Emilie Courtin (LSHTM). I'm interested analytic and mechanistic modelling approaches applied to answer questions related to links between exposures, biological pathways, and health and disease during lifecourse. During my PhD I'd like to get better at data science and writing efficient and reproducible code as well as to see how to write reusable pieces of code as functions. Feedback is much appreciated. Happy coding!
